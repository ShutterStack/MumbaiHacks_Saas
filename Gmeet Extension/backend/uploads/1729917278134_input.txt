Problem statement: 
Design a CGAN generative model that can generate the few fake images from the provided data. Use the CIFAR-10 dataset to train a Conditional GAN. Take user input for class type and generate images of the specified class type using the Conditional GAN.

Data set description:
The CIFAR-10 dataset is a popular image dataset with following attributes. 

Total No. of Images: 60000 

Color Images: Yes (RGB) 

Image Size: 32x32 

Number of classes: 10 classes (6000 images per class)

There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.

The 10 classes are: 

airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck

The CIFAR-10 dataset is available as a part of tensorflow-keras datasets module. Below code can be used to load the CIFAR-10 dataset.
